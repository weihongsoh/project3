### Project Name: *Kcal*culate

### Team Name: Counting Bros


#### *Kcal*culate 

A health and fitness application used to log nutritional data from daily meals, built with React and MongoDB (MERN stack). 

Libraries used: Moment.js, Chart.js, Tailwind CSS

## Project Status
Version 1.0 

This app was created by Iman Maliki, Soh Wei Hong, and Alexander Koh as part of the requirements in their General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course.

## App Functions:

The main functions of the app is working. Users can do the following:

 - **Account Creation**: Users of the app can create an account and store their data. Data presented in their daily logs are specific to their nutritional logs
 - **Dashboard**: Users can view their daily nutritional information and personal goals (Overview, Weight Watch, Remaining Macronutrients (calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats) in the day
 - **Log Information**: Users can log their daily nutritional information by searching for what they have consumed and entering the results into their database. This search calls upon the Nutrition Ninja API 
 - **Log History**: Users can see their last 7 days of nutritional information (calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats). This is displayed in a graph and a sidebar. Clicking on the sidebar will allow users to see the breakdown of that day's nutritional information (what food entires, macronutritional data)
 - **Settings**: Users can change their settings (password, weight, target macronutritional data, target weight) 
 - **Logout**: Users can log out of their accounts.

## Reflection


This was a week long group project built during the third module at General Assembly (GA) Singapore (SEI-31). Project goals include:
 - (1) Building a frontend with React
 - (2) Connecting frontend and backend with APIs
 - (3) Storing data in an online database such as MongoDB Atlas
 - (4) How to collaborate in a team by using GitHub (fetch, commit, push, pull cycle) 

We reinforced our understanding of the content taught by GA by using a MERN stack to achieve our app's functions. 

Alex:
The main features I contributed to in this group project are (1) Pulling from CalorieNinja's API and storing information in the database, (2) Displaying insights in the Log History page. 

Iman: 
The main features I contribute to in this group project are (1) Overall design, (2) Dashboard

Wei Hong: 
The main features I contributed to were (1) User sign-up and sign-in (2) User authentication
